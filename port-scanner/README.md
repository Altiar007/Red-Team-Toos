# Port Scanner
It is a simple **Python Script** which uses **Scoket Library** to Scan and Display Open Ports. It can scan a **Website** as well as a **Router**.

- The Ports to be scanned can be **Changed** in the Script.
- You can enter **Multiple Targets** at once and It will scan each Target **One By One**.
- You can either specify the **IP Address** of the Target or the **Domain Name**. The Script will **Automatically Identify** and **Convert** the Domain Name to IP Address and Scan that Address. Fot this feature, the script uses **IPy Library**.
